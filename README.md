# Iris Dataset – Basic EDA (Beginner)

This is my first machine learning practice project.  
In this notebook, I explored the Iris dataset and performed simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

## 📌 What I learned
- How to load datasets from `sklearn`
- How to create a pandas DataFrame
- How to check the shape, columns, and missing values
- How to view summary statistics
- How to plot simple graphs

## 📂 Contents
- `iris_basic_eda.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with:
  - Loading the Iris dataset  
  - Basic exploration  
  - Histograms  
  - Optional: pairplot

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## 🎯 Goal
This project is the first step in my machine learning journey.  
I will keep adding more notebooks as I learn more concepts step by step.

## 📝 Progress

### Day 1 – Basic EDA
- Loaded the Iris dataset  
- Explored shape, columns, and missing values  
- Viewed summary statistics  
- Plotted histograms  

### Day 2 – First ML Model
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained a Logistic Regression model  
- Made predictions  
- Calculated accuracy score  
- Understood warnings and how to handle them.

### Day 3 – Model Evaluation
- Generated confusion matrix to check correct vs incorrect predictions  
- Visualized the matrix using seaborn heatmap  
- Generated classification report to understand precision, recall, F1-score  
- Observed that the model performs very well for all 3 classes
-  Understood precision, recall, F1-score

### Day 4 Summary
- Learned what KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm is  
- Trained KNN model on Iris dataset  
- Compared it with Logistic Regression  
- Observed accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Understood that different models give different results
