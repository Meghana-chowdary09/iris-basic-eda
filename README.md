# Iris Dataset – Basic EDA (Beginner)

This is my first machine learning practice project.  
In this notebook, I explored the Iris dataset and performed simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

## 📌 What I learned
- How to load datasets from `sklearn`
- How to create a pandas DataFrame
- How to check the shape, columns, and missing values
- How to view summary statistics
- How to plot simple graphs

## 📂 Contents
- `iris_basic_eda.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with:
  - Loading the Iris dataset  
  - Basic exploration  
  - Histograms  
  - Optional: pairplot

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## 🎯 Goal
This project is the first step in my machine learning journey.  
I will keep adding more notebooks as I learn more concepts step by step.

## 🌟 Next Steps
- Learn train/test split  
- Try simple ML models  
- Explore other datasets (Titanic, Heart Disease, etc.)
